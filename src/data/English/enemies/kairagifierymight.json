Their blade's edges are not cold like ordinary steel, but instead burn with a bitter flame. They seem to have used paper seals, created from a lost Kamuna art, to set their blades afire.",

Depending on their temperament or the nature of their crimes, they are also known as the \"homeless ones,\" \"vagabonds,\" \"Kairagi,\" \"ne'er-do-wells,\" or even \"the rioters,\" or just simply known collectively as \"those rogues.\"\\nThey are often samurai who have fallen into banditry, and some will even ally themselves with the Treasure Hoarders or the Fatui for survival or monetary gain."
